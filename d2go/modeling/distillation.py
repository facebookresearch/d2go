# This is the main definition of distillation components in D2Go. This
# includes:
#   DistillationModelingHook => how we update the student model to obtain
#     distillation methods and properties (e.g., override model.forward)
#   DistillationAlgorithm => how we define what occurs during distillation
#     (e.g., specific forward func, teacher weights updates)
#   DistillationHelper => main class users should use to customize their
#     distllation (e.g., define how to pseudo label inputs)
#
# We use two additional registries so that users can select their
# distillation algorithms in configs: DISILLATION_ALAGORITHM, DISTILLATION_HELPER
