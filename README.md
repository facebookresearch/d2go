# D2Go

D2Go is a production ready software system from FacebookResearch, which supports end-to-end model training and deployment for mobile platforms.

## What's D2Go

- It is a deep learning toolkit powered by [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2).
- State-of-the-art efficient backbone networks for mobile devices.
- End-to-end model training, quantization and depoyment pipeline.
- Easy export to TorchScript format for deployment.

## Installation

Install PyTorch Nightly (use CUDA 10.2 as example, see details at [PyTorch Website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/)):

```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch-nightly
```

Install Detectron2 (other installation options at [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/master/INSTALL.md)):

```bash
python -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git'
```
